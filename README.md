# Northern Leaf Blight Detection in Maize Using Image Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on the early detection of Northern Leaf Blight (NLB), a common disease in maize, using image classification. NLB leads to significant crop loss and poses a threat to food security, especially in regions heavily reliant on maize as a staple food. By implementing machine learning and computer vision techniques, this tool provides an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly solution for farmers, agricultural researchers, and policymakers.

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have the latest version installed.
- **Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab**: For interactive code execution and modification.

### Libraries

This project uses several Python libraries,including:
 os, cv2, shutil, random, numpy, pandas, PIL , seaborn, tensorflow,tabulate, matplotlib, tensorflow.keras and  sklearn etc

 You can install them using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
```

### Hardware Requirements

- **Processor**: Intel i7 or equivalent.
- **Memory**: 16 GB RAM.
- **Storage**: At least 10 GB of available space.

## Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available through the [Open Science Framework (OSF)] (https://osf.io/p67rz/). It includes images of healthy maize plants and those infected with NLB, providing a diverse and comprehensive foundation for training our machine learning model.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download this repository** to your machine.
2. **Install necessary Python libraries** or open the notebook in Google Colab.
3. **Download the dataset** from the provided link and add it to your project directory.

## Structure
(To insert Github links here)
- `NLB_Detection_Capstone_Project.ipynb`: The Colab notebook containing the full analysis and model development code.
- `/data/`: The directory where the dataset is placed.
- `/models/`: Trained models and model parameters -notebook
- `/results/`: Graphs, visualizations, and analytical results-PPT

## Usage

1. Open the colab notebook `NLB_Detection_Capstone_Project.ipynb`.
2. If using locally, run all the cells in sequence. If using Google Colab, you can simply click on `Runtime > Run all`.
3. The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations. Follow each section to understand the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps.
